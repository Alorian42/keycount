# TODO
## Make sure addon does not reset in the following scenarios:
    - Other player leaves and rejoins party during active challenge mode
    - Other player leaves party but dungeon is still finished

## Improve death recording
    - Register cause of death
    - Register encounter at time of death (boss/trash) with timestamp

## GUI
    - Add dropdown for filter keys
    - BUG: changing filter types between rate and filter clears the input field, but retains the key/value information

## Notes section
    - At the end of a failed run ask player for a note on that run (popup?)
    - Store note with the dungeon data
    - Add 'notes' column to gui (with mouseover or side scrollable)

## Data filter
    - BUG: filtering by date doesn't work
    - Add selection for data over all seasons
